# Bulldozer Price Prediction (Regression)

## Overview
This project predicts the sale prices of bulldozers using a regression model. It uses historical auction data and machine learning techniques to make accurate price predictions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning using `pandas`
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with `matplotlib`
- Machine learning model training using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluation using metrics such as MAE, RMSLE, and RÂ² Score

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Train the regression model and evaluate its performance.
3. Use the `show_scores(model)` function to check model accuracy.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
